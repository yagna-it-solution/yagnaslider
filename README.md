A SharePoint client side image slider webpart. It is developed with React and typescript. There is starting slide image animation. User can add slide and choose image from the property. Each slide have its own property. There are also slider property.

It is SharePoint online modern page client side webpart. If you want, you can use it in SharePoint 2019 or 2016.

How to use it:

Before download or run make sure you have node latest version and gulp installed in your system. 

First of all, download the repository. Unzip the files in a folder.

Then from command prompt run 
$ npm install or npm i

So it will install all the required npm packages.

Then run the gulp command -

gulp serve 

It will load in your default browser. 

!caution: If you are running it in your local brunch, then you might not able to include the slide image. Because this feature is only for 
the Sharepoint on premise.
